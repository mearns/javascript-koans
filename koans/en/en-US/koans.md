## 0001 - Promises

A mid-level developer was struggling to understand asynchronous coding in JavaScript.

A senior developer offered, "There is an article that may be of interest to you. It will take some time for me to find it. What would you like me to do when I find it."

"Email it to me," was the response.

"And what would you like me to do if I fail to find it?"

"Just email me to let me know, and I'll figure out how to handle it," replied the more junor developer.

"And after I've emailed you, will you please make sure tell me if it helped?"

"I promise," the other replied, and in that moment, was enlightened.

## 0002 - Wildest Streams

In the days of A+, Staltz was showing a developer how to fulfill a Promise with a value.

"And what if I want to fulfill with an array of values?" asked the student.

"You simply fulfill with the array," replied the master.

"And what if I want to do something asynchronous with each result?" asked the student.

"You can map over the array with `Promise.all`" replied the master.

"And what if each value is available at a different time?" asked the student.

"What is your application?" asked the master.

"Streaming data," replied the student.

In that moment, Staltz was englightened.

## 0003 - Bounded Glory

An experienced developer was struggling to use an object method as a callback function.

"No matter what I do, `this` is bound to the global object!" they lamented.

Overhearing this, a more experienced developer replied "The dot operator is no mere value accessor."

With this, the other developer was enlightened.

## 0004 - Deletion and Omission

"Master," questioned a student, "how is it that the `delete` operator knows to remove a property from an object. Do you not provide it with only a right hand value?"

"Add yourself to this list," demanded the master. The student took the paper from the master and wrote down their name.

"I asked you to add yourself to the list, but all you've added is your name," observed the master.

"My name is how I am presented on paper," replied the student.

"And the value of a property is how it is presented in an expression," replied the master. With that, the student was englightened.

## 0005 - Clarity

A senior engineer was reviewing the code of a junior engineer, and suggested they replace the use of a `for` loop with a `forEach` call.

A staff engineer was reviewing the senior engineer's review and pointed out that the original `for` loop was actually more performant.

The junior engineer asked "Was it not clear and comprehensible the way it was originally written?"

The senior and staff engineers were thus enlightened.
